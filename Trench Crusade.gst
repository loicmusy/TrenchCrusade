      <description>A Ranged Weapon with BLAST (X”) has a blast radius in inches equal to X (including vertically). When you make an attack with the Weapon, you must pick a target point for the attack. The target point can either be a point on the Battlefield or an enemy model; whichever you choose must be within the attacking model’s Line of Sight and the Weapon’s range. If the Success Roll for the attack is a Failure, the attack misses and nothing happens unless the weapon also has the SCATTER Keyword. If the Success Roll for the attack is a Success or Critical Success, make an Injury Roll for every model within the Weapon’s blast radius as long as a line of sight exists between the model and the target point. Note that the Shooting into Melee rule does not apply to a BLAST (models within the blast radius are automatically hit whether they are within 1&quot; of an enemy model or not). If you roll a Critical Success, you only add +1 INJURY DICE to the roll for a model if it was chosen as the target point of the attack.</description>

This Effect is ignored if the Success Roll is already a Risky Success Roll.</description>

      <description>Some attacks by the weaponry of the Black Grail causes their opponents to suffer INFECTION MARKERS. These work exactly like BLOOD MARKERS, except if a model has one or more INFECTION MARKERS when activated, it gains + 1 INFECTION MARKER.


INFECTION MARKERS can be used to modify dice rolls exactly like BLOOD MARKERS. Use a different coloured dice (the more disgusting the better!) to indicate these markers and place them next to the infected model. A model may have up to six INFECTION MARKERS and six BLOOD MARKERS at the same time. If a model had any INFECTION MARKERS before, but has none when it is Activated, no new ones are added to the model – though it can still be re-infected by further attacks!</description>

For example, you might say Carl and Gustav are in Fireteam 1 (or Alpha, or Swift Death), while Birgit and Ottokar are in Fireteam 2 (or Gamma, or Crushing Blow). Models that are part of the same Fireteam are Activated simultaneously. They can take their ACTIONS in any order you wish, and you can switch between the two models freely. However, if the Activation of either member of the Fireteam ends (due to a failed Risky Success Roll for example), it immediately ends for the other model that is in the Fireteam too.</description>
